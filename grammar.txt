Naming conventions
  - Objects in CamelCaps
  - Keywords [define, set] in lowercase (single word)
  - Variables in snake_case
  - Constants in ALL_CAPS
  - Attributes in snake_case?

We want to have a way to declare objects, or scenarios explicitly by hardcoding them.

Perhaps we have mandatory attributes, then attributes of a fixed type,
and then you can use attributes for anything else yout want just like variables.

I think you still need primitive actions, like pulling from a rope.

Current problems
- How to handle ropes. It's not the same to have a rope stacked than to have it hanging, for example.

Decisions
- Anchor systems will be hardcoded.
